Initial intuition is to solve it like every other dynamic programning or even a subsequence pattern.
This is a solid tricky problem.

[2,7,4,1,8,1]

On thinking more clearly and trying to map to a pattern you already know, this seems to be actually like

minimize the difference between two subsets in the array.

So its a minimum subset sum difference problem at its core.


Lets see how.

Sum = 23
The least we might get is 0. But 23 / 2 is 11.
So we need to see how close we can get to 11?

And thats the subset sum difference. The last value of True in the last iteration will be the difference.
THE GOAL WAS ALWAYS TO FIND THE MINIMUM DIFFERENCE.
